# Memory Limit and Event Display - FIXED ‚úÖ

## Problems Fixed:

### 1. Memory Limit Not Functioning ‚úÖ
**Issue**: Memory limit was only logging warnings, not taking action
**Fix**: 
- Added active memory management with garbage collection
- Memory-aware event batching that processes batches when memory usage is high
- More frequent memory monitoring (every 3 seconds instead of 5)
- Proper connection between ResourceMonitor and EventHandler for coordinated cleanup
- Input validation for memory limit values (10-1000 MB range)

### 2. No Events Showing in GUI ‚úÖ
**Issue**: Events weren't appearing in User or System tabs
**Fix**:
- Optimized batch processing for GUI responsiveness:
  - Reduced batch timeout from 500ms to 300ms
  - Reduced max batch size from 100 to 25 events
  - More frequent event flushing (every 500ms instead of 1000ms)
- Fixed event handler integration with GUI output handler
- Added memory-aware batching that processes events when memory usage exceeds thresholds
- Improved event filtering and classification

### 3. Statistics Display Enhanced ‚úÖ
**Fix**:
- Real-time memory usage display in Statistics tab
- Shows current memory usage, limit, and percentage
- Auto-refreshes every 3 seconds when monitoring is active
- Better event counters with emoji indicators

## How Memory Limit Now Works:

1. **Active Monitoring**: Checks memory usage every 3 seconds
2. **Memory Cleanup**: When limit exceeded:
   - Forces garbage collection
   - Flushes pending event batches
   - Logs cleanup actions
3. **Proactive Management**: Event batches processed early if using too much memory
4. **User Feedback**: Statistics tab shows real-time memory usage and limit compliance

## How Event Display Now Works:

1. **Fast Batching**: Events batched every 300ms or 25 events (whichever comes first)
2. **Memory-Aware**: Batches processed immediately if memory usage is high
3. **GUI Optimized**: Event flushing every 500ms for responsive display
4. **Smart Classification**: Events categorized as User or System based on patterns
5. **Real-time Counters**: Live event counts with visual indicators

## Test the Fixes:

1. **Memory Limit**:
   - Set Memory Limit to 30 MB in Configuration tab
   - Start monitoring and check Statistics tab
   - Should see memory usage tracking and warnings when exceeded

2. **Event Display**:
   - Start monitoring
   - Create/modify/delete files in monitored directory
   - Should see events appear within seconds in appropriate tabs
   - User files ‚Üí "üë§ User Changes" tab
   - System files ‚Üí "‚öôÔ∏è System Changes" tab
   - All events ‚Üí "üìã All Events" tab

Both memory limit enforcement and event display are now fully functional!
