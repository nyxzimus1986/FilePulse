# Development Directory

This directory contains experimental files and development utilities that are not part of the main application but useful for development and debugging.

## Development Files
- `debug_cli.py` - CLI debugging utility

## Purpose
These files are kept separate from the main codebase to maintain a clean project structure while preserving development work that might be useful for future reference or debugging.

## Usage
These files are typically used during development and testing phases and are not required for normal application operation.
