# Memory Limit Functionality - Fixed

## What Was Wrong Before:
The memory limit option in the GUI was not working because:
1. **No Enforcement**: The ResourceMonitor only logged warnings when memory exceeded the limit but took no action
2. **No Memory Management**: There was no mechanism to reduce memory usage when limits were exceeded
3. **No Validation**: Invalid memory limit values weren't properly handled
4. **No Feedback**: Users had no way to see current memory usage or if limits were working

## What Has Been Fixed:

### 1. **Active Memory Management** 
- Added `_reduce_memory_usage()` method that:
  - Forces garbage collection when memory exceeds limit
  - Flushes pending event batches to free memory
  - Logs memory cleanup actions
  - Reports memory usage after cleanup

### 2. **Memory-Aware Event Batching**
- Event batches now consider memory usage, not just count/time
- Added `_estimate_batch_memory()` to calculate batch memory usage
- Batches are processed when memory usage exceeds 20% of total limit or 10MB
- Prevents large event batches from consuming too much memory

### 3. **Input Validation**
- Memory limit now validates input values:
  - Minimum: 10 MB
  - Maximum: 1000 MB
  - Shows warnings for invalid values
  - Handles non-numeric input gracefully

### 4. **Real-Time Memory Monitoring**
- Statistics tab now shows:
  - Current memory usage
  - Memory limit setting
  - Percentage of limit used
  - Memory status updates every 5 seconds

### 5. **Better Integration**
- ResourceMonitor now connects to EventHandler for coordinated memory management
- GUI shows memory usage in statistics
- Periodic memory cleanup during monitoring

## How to Test:

1. **Set Memory Limit in GUI:**
   - Go to Configuration tab
   - Set "Memory Limit (MB)" to a low value (e.g., 30 MB)
   - Click "Apply Settings"

2. **Monitor Memory Usage:**
   - Go to Statistics tab
   - Click "Start Monitoring" 
   - Watch memory usage display
   - Create files to generate events

3. **Verify Memory Management:**
   - If memory exceeds limit, you'll see warnings in console
   - Garbage collection will be triggered automatically
   - Event batches will be processed more frequently
   - Statistics will show current memory usage

## Memory Limit Guidelines:
- **Minimum recommended**: 20-30 MB for basic monitoring
- **Typical usage**: 50-100 MB for normal operations  
- **Heavy usage**: 100-200 MB for system-wide monitoring
- **Maximum**: 1000 MB (but usually not needed)

The memory limit now actively manages and enforces memory usage rather than just displaying warnings!
