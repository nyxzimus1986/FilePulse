FilePulse GUI Testing Instructions
==================================

The GUI should now be working correctly. Here's how to test it:

1. Run the GUI:
   python launch_gui.py
   OR
   python -c "import sys; sys.path.insert(0, '.'); from filepulse.cli import main; main()" gui

2. In the GUI window:
   - The default monitoring path should be '.' (current directory)
   - Make sure the events you want are checked (created, modified, deleted, moved)
   - Click "Start Monitoring"

3. Create test files to see events:
   - Open another terminal/command prompt
   - Navigate to this directory
   - Create, modify, or delete files:
     echo "test" > test_file.txt
     echo "modified" > test_file.txt  
     del test_file.txt

4. You should see events appear in the GUI tabs:
   - "User Changes" tab for normal file operations
   - "System Changes" tab for system-generated files
   - "All Events" tab for everything combined

The debug output should also print to the console where you launched the GUI.

Previous issues that were fixed:
- CLI module was empty (now has proper main() function)
- GUI event processing (added proper event queue handling)
- Event batching and flushing (events are now properly delivered to GUI)
- Config save method mismatch (fixed save_to_file -> save)

If you still don't see events in the GUI:
1. Check that "Start Monitoring" was clicked
2. Try creating files in the current directory where you launched the GUI
3. Check the console output for debug messages
4. Make sure the files you're creating aren't being filtered out by the exclude patterns

The GUI should work now! Try it and let me know if you see the events.
